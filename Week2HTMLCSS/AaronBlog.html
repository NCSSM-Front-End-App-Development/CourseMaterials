        <b><p>Today I went to class online due to Condition 2! </p></b>
        <p>My first class was AP Physics C with Dr. Wheeler, he was very gracious and canceled the class. Then I had piano and guitar which just took attendance in the zoom. My last morning class was complex systems and modern networks! We actually met in class to work on our podwork assignment.</p>
