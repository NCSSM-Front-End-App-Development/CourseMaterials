For your first assignment, you will create the html and css for a blog post! The example describes some of my classes today but you can make your own selections.

There are two criteria for this assignment: 
We want you to learn both Flexbox and Grid

An example of these two usages would be creating a photo gallery with grid and a navigator tab with flexbox.
Good luck!
